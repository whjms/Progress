2 options:

1:
  * Setup the KillQuest, ItemQuest, LootItem, EquipmentItem classes
  * Create some sort of class that would manage the generation and creation of
    either type of Quest. The type of class would be randomly selected, and the
    methods for accessing quest data (length, reward, item reward) would be
    abstracted from MainWindow by this class.

2:
  * Look into some way of refactoring the Items and Quests (templates or
    inheritance) to make them accessible using common methods
